Context:
you want a program that reads hexadecimal numbers from the standard input (your keyboard) and prints out on the screen the binary 
representation of that numbers.  
Write on your command line:

```
$ gcc hex_to_decimal.c  
$ ./a.out
```

and now you can enter a number, press the ENTER key, and you will see on the screen the decimal representation of the number. 
To stop the program when you have finished, press the combination of keys CONTROL + C (or close the window).    
The benefits of that program over a web converter is that:  
- you can use it without internet connection  
- you can enter numbers and get their representation printed on the screen in a more comfortable way
(no need to "push" "Convert" button or similar).
- you can save the output directly into a file(ex: $ ./a.out >> output_file.txt)
<br/><br/>
Note:   $      is the prompt of the command line and you don't have to write it.
